<h1> Favortie Places In Washington Heights</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Legendary Hill is the bike path in Ft. Tryon park that my friends and I have been going down since 8th grade. Legendary hill consists of 3 parts, the first of which is a bike path along the road where cars go down. This part of the hill is the longest and the least steep, but you nonetheless fly down a hill as cars pass you. After a short uphill portion, the hill reaches its second part (my favorite part). It is an extremely steep hill that has a few twists and turns, but because my friends and I are so fond of the hill we are able to do it with ease. None of us have ever fallen off our bikes while riding down Legendary Hill, so I would consider it pretty safe. While this portion of the hill is the most fun, it is not where we reach top speed. That would be in the third and final part of legendary hill, where it comes to an end. Here it is just straight downwards at a steep incline, almost as a ramp that levels out at the end. That concludes my favorite biking spot!</li>
  <li>Georges Pizza is my go to spot for some good food! Georges serves some of the biggest pizza slices I've seen, and for a great price also ($5.50 for 2 slices and a drink is the special I usually get)! I've been going there for as long as I can remember, and the people there have seen me grow up.</li>
  <li>The School Yard is a household name in Washington Heights, and it is what the name entails, the backyard of my former school (PS 187). I went to that school since I was in kindergarten, and the School Yard is where I made most of my young childhood memories with friends. Playing games like Freeze Tag or Ultimate Ball (which is Ultimate Frizzbee but with ball instead) comprises much of the School Yard experience, and it is still prominent in my life after graduating middle school. I often go with friends to play baseball or football, and will occasionally see my former teachers while at the School Yard. </li>
  <li>The corner of 183rd and Fort Washington has been dubbed “The Corner” by me and my closest friends. It came to be that way because on days that we would hang out in the neighborhood, we wanted to find a meeting spot that was somewhat equidistant from all of our apartment. While that proved to be difficult, we eventually found The Corner sometime in 2019, and has been the meeting place since then.</li>
  <li>The Spot is a place in Ft. Tryon Park, and is one of my favorite places to be when it is nice outside and I want to relax. The Spot is located behind The Cloisters museum in the park, and is cut off from the rest of the park. It has rocks to sit on and is pretty spacious, and is where my friends and I like to go hang out. Ft. Tryon is full of hidden gems like The Spot.</li>

<h1><p>Washington Heights: My Neighborhood<p></h1>

<p>Washington Heights, New York: one of the more rural areas in Manhattan. Despite being blocks away from the busiest bridge in the world, I can't hear a single outside noise from my first floor apartment. I was born and raised here in the Heights, and I am proud to call this place my home for 15 years and counting. Part of the rural-like living that I was fortunate to have in such a busy city was being able to attend one school from kindergarten all the way through 8th grade. Over that time I have made unforgettable memories with the friends I have known my whole life: one of those being the discovery of “Legendary Hill” in Ft. Tryon park.<p>

<p>I often go biking through Ft. Tryon park with my 3 best friends whose names are Henry, Riley, and Filip. We always stuck to one path that was close to the entrance of the park: it was an entertaining ride because of the people I was biking with, but did not demonstrate thrill at its peak. July 24th of 2018 was just going to be one of the days going down that path, but of course that is not how it went down in history. That was the day the four of us decided to bike down the designated Ft. Tryon bike path, which we knew to be a steep hill and had been too afraid to go down until that summer day. We took our bikes to the top of the hill, and looked down at what could be our biggest regret. We mustered up the courage to go down together, and man what an experience it was. We traveled down the path at the speed of the cars that zoomed past us while we took in the sight of the trees and grass surrounding us. Images of neighbors participating in their daily activities quickly faded out of sight as I sped along the simple yet thrilling path. As I passed the open grass fields to my left, I envisioned myself playing tag with the people who were riding right alongside me; it brought me back to a younger time, a time where the only worry was not getting tagged. That's when it hit me that I have only scratched the surface of what my childhood park had to offer.<p>

<p>It is not often that something new happens in our neighborhood; somehow everyday here is mundane but is never boring. Moments like the discovery of Legendary Hill is what makes this neighborhood so special: it allows us to create our own fun. Washington Heights offers us the space of Ft. Tryon park, and even offers more such as our local schoolyard and another park called Bennett park. It is how we use those spaces that count. Legendary Hill is just one of the many examples of how extravangacy is not required to have a good time.<p>

<p>I would be lying if I said that I haven't gone down Legendary Hill at least 100 times. Out of those times, I went down the hill once by myself; it was simply not the same experience. What makes Legendary Hill live up to its name is the fact that I can enjoy the experience with the friends I have grown up with and have evolved with. Having all known each other from the age of 5, we have experienced many major milestones together, including a couple of graduations. Legendary Hill provides me with the feeling of the air crashing against my face as I zoom past my childhood memories, but what makes it even more special is how I can experience that feeling with the people I made those memories with. I will be forever grateful for Ft. Tryon park and Washington Heights for allowing me to create unforgettable memories with the people that have been there since day one.<p>

<p>Thank you Washington Heights.<p></div>

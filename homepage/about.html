<h1>About Me</h1>
My Name is Nicholas Mancuso, and I go to NEST+m High School in NYC. I am proud to be a born and raised New Yorker, residing in the same Manhattan apartment my whole life. As you could tell by the title of this homepage, Washington Heights is the neighborhood I call home, and has been a major role player in my life experiences. A little about me however is that I am a very big fan of sports, and have played sports my entire life. This year alone, I was the starting Goalie for the NEST Soccer team, and will be the starting Shortstop for the NEST baseball team. While injuries have been the story of my high school athletics career, these past few months have been my most healthy months yet. In my free time, I like to hang out with friends and play piano, and my interests are in building LEGOs and researching baseball statistics. My favorite TV show is New Girl (where my favorite character is also named Nick) and my favorite food is either Pizza or Dumplings. I take pride in my multi-etnic background, mainly being Ecuadorian, Korean, Italian, and Filipino. Coming from different backgrounds allows me to enjoy freshly cooked Korean food from the Korean side of my family, and equally amazing Ecuadorian food with the other family. Hope you enjoy the essay!
